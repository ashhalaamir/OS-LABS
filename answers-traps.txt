1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

 In RISC-V, the first six function arguments are passed through registers a0 to a5. In this case, the
 value 57616 is stored in register a1.

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may
inline functions.)

 The call to f is inlined by the compiler, meaning its code is directly inserted rather than invoked as a separate
 function call. The call to g, however, appears explicitly in the assembly as a 'call g' or 'jalr' instruction.

3. At what address is the function printf located?

 The printf function is located at the memory address 0x80002930.

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

 Immediately after executing the jalr instruction to printf, the ra (return address) register holds the address 
 of the next instruction that follows the jalr call.

5. Run the following code.
        unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
        printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, (char *) &i);
What is the output?
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian,
what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

 Output is He010 World.
 Big-Endian representation of i: 0x726c6400. The value 57616 remains unchanged.

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) 
Why does this happen?
        printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

 It prints a garbage value. printf expects two arguments but only receives one (3), so it reads the second from an 
 uninitialized register (a2) or stack location.
