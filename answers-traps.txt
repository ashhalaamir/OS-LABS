---------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM SET 4 TRAP ANSWERS--------------------------------------------------------------------
A1: a0 to a5 hold arguments to functions. register a1 hold 13 in main's call to printf.
A2: call o f's code is directly inserted rather than called a separate function call. Call to g appears in assembly as call g.
A3: printf located at 0x80002930.
A4: return address (ra) holds address of next instruction that follows jalr call, just after jalr printf in main.
A5: output = He010 World. 57616 is unchanged, big-endian i would be 0x726c400.
A6: a garbage value is printed as printf requires 2 arguments instead of 1. It will read the other from a stack location or an uninitialized register.
